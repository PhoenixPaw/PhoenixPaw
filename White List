### üîç **PhoenixPaw Project Overview**

PhoenixPaw is a unique crypto ecosystem designed to support environmental and charitable initiatives. The project leverages advanced blockchain technologies to create a universal platform where users can interact with tokens, NFTs, and contribute to global positive change. The primary goal of PhoenixPaw is to unite people worldwide to protect endangered animal species and nature.

The main foundation of PhoenixPaw is built on the Solana blockchain, with additional support from the TON network to ensure cross-chain compatibility and user convenience.

### üíº **Project Tokenomics**

The PhoenixPaw project launches the PHXPW token, which is used for:

- Cashback for purchases within the application and ecosystem.
- Acquiring NFTs and in-game items.
- Participating in quests and daily missions.
- Voting on environmental initiatives.

The total supply of PHXPW tokens is 1 billion. Currently, approximately 12 million tokens have been burned. 20% of the tokens are locked for at least one year, and another 20% are locked for periods ranging from six months to two years. Around 37% of tokens remain in the liquidity pool. Staking through jvault.xyz on the 2Trust platform offers returns ranging from 100% to 500% annually and will be replenished over time.

Additionally, a 15,000,000 PHXPW issuance is planned, where users must lock tokens for at least 360 days to access certain ecosystem features.
